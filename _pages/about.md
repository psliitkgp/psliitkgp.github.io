Welcome to Photonics Systems Laboratory , Led by <a href='https://www.iitkgp.ac.in/department/PH/faculty/ph-kiranbhaktha'>Shivakiran B N Bhaktha</a>. We work in the area of ORDERED and DISORDERED Photonics. Periodic and random structures are fabricated and studied in our lab to understand the behaviour of light in these systems, and also for the development of photonic devices. 
Some of our primary research interests include:
- Random Lasers
- Photonic Crystals
- Plasmonics
- Glass Photonics
- Glass Ceramics
- Optofluidics
- Micro-resonators
- Nonlinear Optics
- Photonic Devices and Sensors
