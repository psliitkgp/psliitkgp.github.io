	abstract = {Optical Tamm structures have potential for the development of optoelectronic devices, provided they overcome the challenge of low-quality factor of modes and inherent losses associated with plasmonic metal films. In this work, we present lasing in a super-Tamm structure consisting of a silver thin film deposited on a 4-(dicyanomethylene)-2-methyl-6-(4- dimethylaminostyryl)-H-pyran (DCM) dye-doped polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) spacer layer coated on a SiO

              one-dimensional photonic crystal with a lasing threshold of ∼0.07 mJ. The spectral line narrowing and threshold characteristics observed in the emission spectrum corroborate the realization of a waveguided super-Tamm laser. The bi-exponential temporal decay profile of the Tamm lasing modes with an average lifetime of 0.52 ± 0.02 ns confirms the Purcell enhancement of radiative intensity of the DCM dye when coupled to the super-Tamm modes.},

	abstract = {Rare-earth doped transparent glass-ceramic waveguides are playing a very crucial role in integrated optics. We fabricated ZnO-HfO2 hybrid nanocrystals embedded with 70 SiO2–(30-x) HfO2–x ZnO (x = 0, 2, 5 and 7 mol \%) ternary transparent glass-ceramic waveguides doped with 1 mol \% Eu-ions. The formation and size of the nanocrystals evolved with an increase in ZnO concentration in the glass-ceramic waveguides. In this context, key factors of such nanocrystals embedded active glass-ceramic waveguides were optical losses and transparency. A lab-built m-line experimental set-up was used for the characterization of the waveguides. On the other hand, optical gain measurements of the Eu-doped hybrid nanocrystals embedded glass-ceramic waveguides were performed using the variable stripe length method. The optical amplification of the waveguides was investigated on the red emission line (5D0 → 7F2) of Eu-ions pumped by a 532 nm laser in a stripe-like geometry generated by a cylindrical lens. Here, we report, the optical gain in rare-earth activated glass-ceramic waveguides with nanocrystals of varying sizes formed in the waveguides with increasing ZnO concentration.},
